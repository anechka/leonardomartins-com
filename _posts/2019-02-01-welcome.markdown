You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory.[^1] Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
import numpy as np
def euclidean(x, y):
  return np.linalg.norm(x - y)
```

As well as for mathematical expressions, both inline $$x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ and in blocks:

$$\sqrt{\sum_k^n \left(x_k - y_k\right)^2}$$

Jekyll and kramdown also support tables:

| **x** | **y** |
|---+---|
| $$x_1$$ | $$y_1$$ |
| $$x_2$$ | $$y_2$$ |
| $$x_3$$ | $$y_3$$ |
